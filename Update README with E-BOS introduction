# E-BOS — Ethical Behaviour Operating System

Ethical Behaviour Operating System (E-BOS) is a governance-grade operating layer for embedding ethical decision logic, accountability, and human-dignity constraints into complex institutional systems across government, academia, infrastructure, and regulated environments.
> This repository introduces the E-BOS field, explains the systemic gap it addresses, and outlines licensed pathways for institutional evaluation and integration.
## What E-BOS Is

E-BOS is an ethical behaviour orchestration layer that operates across complex institutional environments where decisions are distributed, contextual, and consequential.

It is designed to support systems where:
- responsibility is shared across people and technology,
- decisions must remain accountable under pressure,
- ethical intent must translate into operational reality,
- and human dignity must be preserved within automated and semi-automated processes.

E-BOS functions as a governing layer that aligns policy, behaviour, and system logic without replacing existing frameworks or institutional controls.
